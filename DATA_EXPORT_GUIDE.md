## ‚ùì Common Issues & Solutions

### "No valid walks found"
- **Check file format**: Must be `.tcx` files
- **Check content**: Files must contain GPS tracks, not just summary data
- **Check activity type**: Must be marked as "Walking" in the TCX file
- **Check date range**: Make sure you have recent walking data

### "Files won't convert"
- **Try different converters**: Some work better than others
- **Check source quality**: Original GPS tracks must be valid
- **Split large files**: Some converters have size limits

### "Export is taking forever"
- **Google Takeout**: Can take 6-24 hours for large accounts
- **Apple Health**: Try smaller date ranges
- **Strava**: Usually faster, within 24 hours

### "No GPS data in export"
- **Privacy settings**: Check that location services were enabled
- **App permissions**: Ensure fitness apps had location access
- **Indoor activities**: Treadmill walks won't have GPS data

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start small**: Export just a month of data first to test the process
2. **Check your data**: Open a TCX file in a text editor to verify it has GPS coordinates
3. **Regular exports**: Set a reminder to export data monthly/quarterly
4. **Backup everything**: Keep copies of your exported data
5. **Test with legacy cities**: Use `new_york` or `london` to test before processing your own city

---

## üÜò Need More Help?

1. **Check the processing log**: Look at `processing.log` for detailed error messages
2. **Validate your city first**: Use `--validate-only` flag to test city support
3. **Try legacy cities**: Test with New York or London first
4. **Check file contents**: Open TCX files in a text editor to verify GPS data
5. **Ask for help**: Create an issue on GitHub with your error messages
